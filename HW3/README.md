### Homework 3 - Train a discriminator/generator pair on CIFAR10 dataset utilizing techniques from DCGAN and Wasserstein GANs
#### Namita Vagdevi Cherukuru C32671672 - ncheruk@clemson.edu

The repository contains the assignment to training a discriminator or the generator pair to determine the best GAN models to generate best images in CIFAR-10 dataset. GANs are a kind of neural networks composed of 2 independent, neural networks, which are consistent with generators (G) and discriminators (D). DCGAN is the basic GAN variants of Deep Convolutionary GANs, where G and D are based on a deep neural network. WGANs are complementary to turns and help the simulation of multi-level long-range dependencies in the image dataset regions.
